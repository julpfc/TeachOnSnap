# TeachOnSnap

This final degree project tries to develop a platform of complementary educational contents based on microblogging. 

Platforms such as Twitter have shown, that publishing a maximum of 140 characters can become a powerful communication tool despite its brevity. The main requirement is that any future development and maintenance of the application would be performed by the students of the Telematics Engineering department at the university, and therefore, must use technologies known during the course and usually managed by them, such as Java, the Apache Tomcat application server and the MySQL database server. Therefore no frameworks are allowed beyond Hibernate. 

“TeachOnSnap” web application will be developed with this aim.
